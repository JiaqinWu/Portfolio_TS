this equation:\n$Series = Trend * Seasonal * Random$\n\n**Number of Daily Vaccinations Per Million:** This metrics reflects the dynamic nature of our battle against the virus, with fluctuations influenced primarily by the evolving strains and their virulence. Noteworthy peaks occurred in April and October of 2021, possibly corresponding to strategic shifts in vaccination drives or response measures. In terms of seasonality, there is no clear sign of seasonality being present, therefore, we can conclude that there isn’t seasonality in the series based on unperceptive pattern. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of People Vaccinated Per Hundred:** This metrics reveals a consistent upward trend over time. Notably, from January 2021 to July 2021, the rate of increase surged significantly compared to the period after July 2021, suggesting a pronounced acceleration in vaccination efforts during that timeframe and indicating a potential decline in the virus’s threat level. Seasonality analysis yields no discernible patterns, as vaccination rates are driven by individual choices rather than seasonal influences. Thus, the absence of any seasonal trends is evident. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of People Fully Vaccinated Per Hundred:** This metrics is similar to the trend of the number of people vaccinated per hundred, which also reveals a consistent upward trend over time. Notably, from January 2021 to July 2021, the rate of increase surged significantly compared to the period after July 2021, suggesting a pronounced acceleration in vaccination efforts during that timeframe and indicating a potential decline in the virus’s threat level. Seasonality analysis yields no discernible patterns, as vaccination rates are driven by individual choices rather than seasonal influences. Thus, the absence of any seasonal trends is evident. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of Newly Confirmed Cases:**  This metric demonstrates a consistent upward trend over time, albeit with varying rates of increase observed across different periods. Notably, from October 2021 to February 2022, there was a notable acceleration in the rise of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. In contrast, during other time periods, the pace of increase remained relatively steady. Despite thorough analysis, no discernible seasonal patterns emerge from this time series, suggesting that the incidence of confirmed cases is not influenced by seasonal factors. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of Death Cases:** The trajectory of death cases is similar to that of newly confirmed cases, depicting an overall upward trend. Noteworthy spikes in the rate of fatalities occurred during specific intervals, especially during October 2020 to April 2021 and October 2021 to February 2022, suggesting heightened mortality rates during these periods. Despite analyzing seasonality, no discernible patterns emerge, indicating that mortality trends are not influenced by seasonal variations. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of Inpatient Beds:** Initially, this series exhibited a sharp increase during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. And starting from October 2020, the number of inpatient beds stabilized and reached a much higher number. The number occasionally fluctuated within a certain range after October 2020. Analysis of seasonality reveals no discernible patterns, indicating the absence of any seasonal influences on the series. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of Inpatient Beds Used for COVID:** This metric exhibits significant fluctuations over time, with notable peaks observed in periods such as January 2021, September 2021, and January 2022, and nowadays the number of inpatient beds used for COVID became much lower. These peaks are not attributable to seasonal variations but rather correlate with surges in COVID-19 cases, often driven by the emergence of new virus variants. Consequently, the absence of any discernible seasonal patterns is evident in this time series. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Utilization Rate for Inpatient Beds Used for COVID:** This metric mirrors the fluctuations observed in the number of inpatient beds occupied by COVID patients, with significant peaks evident during key periods such as January 2021, September 2021, and January 2022. Notably, recent data reflects a marked decline in COVID-related bed occupancy, stabilizing at approximately 5%. These fluctuations are not merely a result of seasonal variations but rather closely align with spikes in COVID-19 cases, often coinciding with the emergence of new virus variants. As such, the absence of discernible seasonal patterns underscores the dynamic nature of this metric, dictated by the evolving landscape of the pandemic. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n\n**GDP Per Capita:** The trajectory of GDP per capita demonstrates a consistent upward trend, indicating economic growth and prosperity over time. Notably, this trend is not subject to seasonal fluctuations, as it is inherently tied to annual economic performance rather than periodic factors. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n\n**Unemployment Rate:** The unemployment time series witnessed a sharp escalation in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly evident in March, as businesses grappled with widespread closures and economic uncertainty. However, in response to this crisis, governments worldwide swiftly implemented policies aimed at stimulating job creation and fostering economic recovery. Consequently, the unemployment rate began a gradual descent post-March 2020, signaling a positive trajectory towards stabilizing the job market. Presently, the unemployment rate hovers around 4%, indicative of a more stabilized employment landscape. Notably, similar to other pandemic-related metrics, the unemployment rate displays minimal seasonality, as its fluctuations are primarily driven by the virus's impact on economic activity rather than seasonal patterns. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n\n**Pfizer Stock Price:** The Pfizer stock price has exhibited significant fluctuations, with notable peaks occurring in October 2020 and February 2021. These spikes can largely be attributed to the successful development and widespread adoption of booster vaccinations during critical phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. The surge in stock value during these periods reflects investor confidence in Pfizer's pivotal role in combating the virus. However, following March 2023, a discernible downward trajectory in stock price emerged, signaling a broader trend of decline within the medical sector during the post-pandemic era. Despite these fluctuations, the stock price demonstrates no clear seasonality, as its movements are intricately linked to the ebb and flow of the COVID-19 virus itself. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n\n**Party Support Rate:**  The party support rate exhibits continuous fluctuations, reflecting the dynamic nature of political sentiment. However, a prevailing trend emerges: the support rate for the Democratic party consistently surpasses that of independent and Republican factions. This enduring pattern underscores the enduring appeal and resonance of Democratic ideals among the populace. The absence of discernible seasonality in these fluctuations underscores that the shifts are driven primarily by the ever-evolving opinions and perceptions of the public rather than external factors tied to specific seasons or events. Party support rates in the US can vary significantly over time due to various factors such as political events, policy decisions, economic conditions, and societal changes. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n\n# 2.

Our methodology employs rigorous statistical tests, complemented by Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plots, to scrutinize the data's behavior over time.\n\n\n**Number of Daily Vaccinations Per Million:** A p-value below 0.05 signals sufficient grounds to reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level, indicating stationarity in our series. This finding, however, contrasts with prior conclusions, suggesting the ACF plot's superior accuracy, which points toward non-stationarity.\n\n**Number of People Vaccinated Per Hundred:** The p-value, exceeding 0.05, reveals an insufficient basis to reject the null hypothesis, indicating a non-stationary series. This necessitates further modifications for stationarity, reinforcing conclusions from earlier analyses, including a significant lag order of 3.\n\n**Number of People Fully Vaccinated Per Hundred:** With a p-value below 0.05, we find adequate evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting stationarity. Yet, this contradicts previous findings, with the ACF plot indicating non-stationarity, challenging our initial conclusion.\n\n**Number of Newly Confirmed Cases:** A p-value above 0.05 indicates a lack of sufficient evidence to dismiss the null hypothesis, suggesting non-stationarity. This aligns with earlier observations, necessitating adjustments for stationarity, including a noted lag order of 3.\n\n**Number of Death Cases:** The p-value, again above 0.05, underscores a lack of adequate evidence to reject the null hypothesis, signaling a non-stationary series and the need for further data adjustments. This finding is consistent with prior analyses.\n\n**Number of Inpatient Beds:** Here, a p-value below 0.05 provides enough justification to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting a stationary series. Nevertheless, this result is at odds with previous analyses, indicating non-stationarity based on the ACF plot.\n\n**Number of Inpatient Beds Used for COVID:** The p-value surpassing 0.05 suggests insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, pointing to a non-stationary series that requires adjustments, corroborating earlier findings and the significance of a lag order of 3.\n\n**Utilization Rate for Inpatient Beds Used for COVID:** A high p-value indicates the series' non-stationarity, echoing the need for adjustments to achieve stationarity and supporting earlier conclusions, including a lag order of 3.\n\n**Unemployment Rate:** A low p-value indicates sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting stationarity. However, this contrasts with previous examples, with the ACF plot indicating non-stationarity.\n\n**Pfizer Stock Price: ** With a p-value exceeding 0.05, there's insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating a non-stationary series requiring adjustments, consistent with earlier findings, including a lag order of 3.\n\n**Support Rate for Democratic:** A high p-value reveals a lack of evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting non-stationarity and the need for adjustments, contradicting earlier conclusions of stationarity.\n\n**Support Rate for Independent:** A low p-value provides ample evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating a stationary series.

While navigating the same goal of trend elimination, these methodologies diverge in their approach and application nuances.\n\nDetrending is a targeted process aimed squarely at eradicating the underlying trend from the dataset. This is accomplished by first meticulously estimating the trend component that permeates the time series and then subtracting this estimated trend from the original dataset. The outcome is a transformed series where the original mean has been adjusted to center around zero, effectively neutralizing the trend influence. However, this transformation is not a panacea; detrended data can still exhibit non-stationary characteristics, such as seasonality or variance instabilities, that require further intervention.\n\nConversely, differencing operates under a broader scope, addressing stationarity by focusing on the differences between consecutive observations. This method is encapsulated by the formula:\n\n$$\\Delta y_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta y_t$ represents the difference between the current observation $y_t$ and its predecessor $y_{t-1}$. Through this simple yet effective mechanism, differencing excels at mitigating linear trends and highlighting the dynamic changes between data points. Its strength lies particularly in contexts where the time series displays a consistent directional trend, making it a robust choice for such scenarios.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while differencing is adept at ironing out linear trends, it may falter when faced with nonlinear trends or pronounced seasonal fluctuations. The essence of differencing lies in its ability to simplify the series to a form where patterns and structures become more discernable, albeit at the potential cost of oversimplification in certain complex scenarios.\n\nThe decision to employ detrending or differencing hinges on a thorough examination of the time series at hand. The specific characteristics of the dataset, including the nature of its trends and seasonalities, dictate the most appropriate method for achieving stationarity. This choice is not merely technical but strategic, laying the foundation for deeper insights and more accurate forecasts in the pursuit of time series analysis.\n\n\n\n# 7.

expanded our analytical toolkit by integrating four distinct moving average windows into the original dataset. This methodical selection spans from agile short-term perspectives to more deliberate long-term vistas. Specifically, we introduced a nimble 3-period moving average (3-MA) to catch immediate trends, alongside two medium-term averages of 12 periods (12-MA) and 16 periods (16-MA), culminating in a comprehensive 24-period moving average (24-MA) to gauge extended trends.\n\nUpon thorough examination, the 12-MA distinctively stands out for its adeptness across various data series. While the 3-MA provides a glimpse into the data's immediate direction, it often glosses over the dataset's more impactful shifts. On the other end of the spectrum, the 16-MA and 24-MA, with their broader strokes, tend to dilute the dataset, masking subtle yet significant patterns, such as seasonal variations that are crucial for holistic analysis.\n\nRemarkably, the 12-MA window adeptly navigates between these extremes. It offers a balanced lens through which meaningful data fluctuations are brought to the forefront, with just enough smoothing to clarify the analysis without erasing important details. This equilibrium is especially beneficial for analyzing spending data, characterized by its smoother fluctuations. Here, the slightly gentler touch of the 12-MA allows us to unearth and understand the underlying trends with greater precision.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(forecast)\nlibrary(astsa) \nlibrary(xts)\nlibrary(tseries)\nlibrary(fpp2)\nlibrary(fma)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(TSstudio)\nlibrary(quantmod)\nlibrary(tidyquant)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(zoo)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n```\n\n# 1.

this equation:\n$Series = Trend * Seasonal * Random$\n\n**Number of Daily Vaccinations Per Million:** This metrics reflects the dynamic nature of our battle against the virus, with fluctuations influenced primarily by the evolving strains and their virulence. Noteworthy peaks occurred in April and October of 2021, possibly corresponding to strategic shifts in vaccination drives or response measures. In terms of seasonality, there is no clear sign of seasonality being present, therefore, we can conclude that there isn’t seasonality in the series based on unperceptive pattern. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of People Vaccinated Per Hundred:** This metrics reveals a consistent upward trend over time. Notably, from January 2021 to July 2021, the rate of increase surged significantly compared to the period after July 2021, suggesting a pronounced acceleration in vaccination efforts during that timeframe and indicating a potential decline in the virus’s threat level. Seasonality analysis yields no discernible patterns, as vaccination rates are driven by individual choices rather than seasonal influences. Thus, the absence of any seasonal trends is evident. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of People Fully Vaccinated Per Hundred:** This metrics is similar to the trend of the number of people vaccinated per hundred, which also reveals a consistent upward trend over time. Notably, from January 2021 to July 2021, the rate of increase surged significantly compared to the period after July 2021, suggesting a pronounced acceleration in vaccination efforts during that timeframe and indicating a potential decline in the virus’s threat level. Seasonality analysis yields no discernible patterns, as vaccination rates are driven by individual choices rather than seasonal influences. Thus, the absence of any seasonal trends is evident. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of Newly Confirmed Cases:**  This metric demonstrates a consistent upward trend over time, albeit with varying rates of increase observed across different periods. Notably, from October 2021 to February 2022, there was a notable acceleration in the rise of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. In contrast, during other time periods, the pace of increase remained relatively steady. Despite thorough analysis, no discernible seasonal patterns emerge from this time series, suggesting that the incidence of confirmed cases is not influenced by seasonal factors. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of Death Cases:** The trajectory of death cases is similar to that of newly confirmed cases, depicting an overall upward trend. Noteworthy spikes in the rate of fatalities occurred during specific intervals, especially during October 2020 to April 2021 and October 2021 to February 2022, suggesting heightened mortality rates during these periods. Despite analyzing seasonality, no discernible patterns emerge, indicating that mortality trends are not influenced by seasonal variations. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of Inpatient Beds:** Initially, this series exhibited a sharp increase during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. And starting from October 2020, the number of inpatient beds stabilized and reached a much higher number. The number occasionally fluctuated within a certain range after October 2020. Analysis of seasonality reveals no discernible patterns, indicating the absence of any seasonal influences on the series. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Number of Inpatient Beds Used for COVID:** This metric exhibits significant fluctuations over time, with notable peaks observed in periods such as January 2021, September 2021, and January 2022, and nowadays the number of inpatient beds used for COVID became much lower. These peaks are not attributable to seasonal variations but rather correlate with surges in COVID-19 cases, often driven by the emergence of new virus variants. Consequently, the absence of any discernible seasonal patterns is evident in this time series. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n**Utilization Rate for Inpatient Beds Used for COVID:** This metric mirrors the fluctuations observed in the number of inpatient beds occupied by COVID patients, with significant peaks evident during key periods such as January 2021, September 2021, and January 2022. Notably, recent data reflects a marked decline in COVID-related bed occupancy, stabilizing at approximately 5%. These fluctuations are not merely a result of seasonal variations but rather closely align with spikes in COVID-19 cases, often coinciding with the emergence of new virus variants. As such, the absence of discernible seasonal patterns underscores the dynamic nature of this metric, dictated by the evolving landscape of the pandemic. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n\n**GDP Per Capita:** The trajectory of GDP per capita demonstrates a consistent upward trend, indicating economic growth and prosperity over time. Notably, this trend is not subject to seasonal fluctuations, as it is inherently tied to annual economic performance rather than periodic factors. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n\n**Unemployment Rate:** The unemployment time series witnessed a sharp escalation in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly evident in March, as businesses grappled with widespread closures and economic uncertainty. However, in response to this crisis, governments worldwide swiftly implemented policies aimed at stimulating job creation and fostering economic recovery. Consequently, the unemployment rate began a gradual descent post-March 2020, signaling a positive trajectory towards stabilizing the job market. Presently, the unemployment rate hovers around 4%, indicative of a more stabilized employment landscape. Notably, similar to other pandemic-related metrics, the unemployment rate displays minimal seasonality, as its fluctuations are primarily driven by the virus's impact on economic activity rather than seasonal patterns. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n\n**Pfizer Stock Price:** The Pfizer stock price has exhibited significant fluctuations, with notable peaks occurring in October 2020 and February 2021. These spikes can largely be attributed to the successful development and widespread adoption of booster vaccinations during critical phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. The surge in stock value during these periods reflects investor confidence in Pfizer's pivotal role in combating the virus. However, following March 2023, a discernible downward trajectory in stock price emerged, signaling a broader trend of decline within the medical sector during the post-pandemic era. Despite these fluctuations, the stock price demonstrates no clear seasonality, as its movements are intricately linked to the ebb and flow of the COVID-19 virus itself. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n\n**Party Support Rate:**  The party support rate exhibits continuous fluctuations, reflecting the dynamic nature of political sentiment. However, a prevailing trend emerges: the support rate for the Democratic party consistently surpasses that of independent and Republican factions. This enduring pattern underscores the enduring appeal and resonance of Democratic ideals among the populace. The absence of discernible seasonality in these fluctuations underscores that the shifts are driven primarily by the ever-evolving opinions and perceptions of the public rather than external factors tied to specific seasons or events. Party support rates in the US can vary significantly over time due to various factors such as political events, policy decisions, economic conditions, and societal changes. Moreover, the series is multiplicative.\n\n\n# 2.

Nevertheless, this result is at odds with previous analyses, indicating non-stationarity based on the ACF plot.\n\n**Number of Inpatient Beds Used for COVID:** The p-value surpassing 0.05 suggests insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, pointing to a non-stationary series that requires adjustments, corroborating earlier findings and the significance of a lag order of 3.\n\n**Utilization Rate for Inpatient Beds Used for COVID:** A high p-value indicates the series' non-stationarity, echoing the need for adjustments to achieve stationarity and supporting earlier conclusions, including a lag order of 3.\n\n**Unemployment Rate:** A low p-value indicates sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting stationarity. However, this contrasts with previous examples, with the ACF plot indicating non-stationarity.\n\n**Pfizer Stock Price: ** With a p-value exceeding 0.05, there's insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating a non-stationary series requiring adjustments, consistent with earlier findings, including a lag order of 3.\n\n**Support Rate for Democratic:** A high p-value reveals a lack of evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting non-stationarity and the need for adjustments, contradicting earlier conclusions of stationarity.\n\n**Support Rate for Independent:** A low p-value provides ample evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating a stationary series. This finding aligns with prior conclusions, affirming the series' stationarity.\n\n**Support Rate for Republican:** The p-value, exceeding 0.05, indicates insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting a non-stationary series that necessitates adjustments, in line with earlier analyses.\n\nThrough this detailed exploration, we meticulously gauge the stationarity of diverse series, juxtaposing statistical test results against ACF plot insights to draw nuanced conclusions on the dynamic interplay between sentiment, stock price movements, and broader socio-economic indicators.\n\n\n# 6.

While navigating the same goal of trend elimination, these methodologies diverge in their approach and application nuances.\n\nDetrending is a targeted process aimed squarely at eradicating the underlying trend from the dataset. This is accomplished by first meticulously estimating the trend component that permeates the time series and then subtracting this estimated trend from the original dataset. The outcome is a transformed series where the original mean has been adjusted to center around zero, effectively neutralizing the trend influence. However, this transformation is not a panacea; detrended data can still exhibit non-stationary characteristics, such as seasonality or variance instabilities, that require further intervention.\n\nConversely, differencing operates under a broader scope, addressing stationarity by focusing on the differences between consecutive observations. This method is encapsulated by the formula:\n\n$$\\Delta y_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta y_t$ represents the difference between the current observation $y_t$ and its predecessor $y_{t-1}$. Through this simple yet effective mechanism, differencing excels at mitigating linear trends and highlighting the dynamic changes between data points. Its strength lies particularly in contexts where the time series displays a consistent directional trend, making it a robust choice for such scenarios.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while differencing is adept at ironing out linear trends, it may falter when faced with nonlinear trends or pronounced seasonal fluctuations. The essence of differencing lies in its ability to simplify the series to a form where patterns and structures become more discernable, albeit at the potential cost of oversimplification in certain complex scenarios.\n\nThe decision to employ detrending or differencing hinges on a thorough examination of the time series at hand. The specific characteristics of the dataset, including the nature of its trends and seasonalities, dictate the most appropriate method for achieving stationarity. This choice is not merely technical but strategic, laying the foundation for deeper insights and more accurate forecasts in the pursuit of time series analysis.\n\n\n\n# 7.

expanded our analytical toolkit by integrating four distinct moving average windows into the original dataset. This methodical selection spans from agile short-term perspectives to more deliberate long-term vistas. Specifically, we introduced a nimble 3-period moving average (3-MA) to catch immediate trends, alongside two medium-term averages of 12 periods (12-MA) and 16 periods (16-MA), culminating in a comprehensive 24-period moving average (24-MA) to gauge extended trends.\n\nUpon thorough examination, the 12-MA distinctively stands out for its adeptness across various data series. While the 3-MA provides a glimpse into the data's immediate direction, it often glosses over the dataset's more impactful shifts. On the other end of the spectrum, the 16-MA and 24-MA, with their broader strokes, tend to dilute the dataset, masking subtle yet significant patterns, such as seasonal variations that are crucial for holistic analysis.\n\nRemarkably, the 12-MA window adeptly navigates between these extremes. It offers a balanced lens through which meaningful data fluctuations are brought to the forefront, with just enough smoothing to clarify the analysis without erasing important details. This equilibrium is especially beneficial for analyzing spending data, characterized by its smoother fluctuations. Here, the slightly gentler touch of the 12-MA allows us to unearth and understand the underlying trends with greater precision.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"embed-resources":true,"output-file":"EDA.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
