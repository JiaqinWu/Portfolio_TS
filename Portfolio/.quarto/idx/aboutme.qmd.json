transformation using Pandas on 20K patients data from **SQL**.\n\n-   Built predictive models for HIV treatment status using techniques like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **SVM**, and **Neural Network** algorithm, and achieved the highest accuracy rate of 91.12\\% with the XGBoost model.\n\n-   Utilized **Multinomial Logistic Regression** algorithm to investigate the factors contributing to the concordance or discordance of IPV behavior reports within couples.\n\n-   Utilized **Logistic Regression** algorithm to analyze factors impacting patient retention and virological status, visualizing correlations and offering strategic insights for policymakers.\n\n-   Enhanced the Haiti Team's analytical capabilities by developing **Dashboards** to present the
