# Personal Portfolio -- Time Series

In this personal portfolio, I focus on a highly relevant and interesting topic: the impact of COVID-19. Using time-series techniques, I explore how COVID-19 has affected various fields. For example, it is evident that COVID-19 has influenced economic indicators such as GDP per capita and the unemployment rate. By applying time-series methods, I aim to understand the specific ways in which these indicators have been impacted.

To achieve a comprehensive analysis, I select indicators from different dimensions to explore both the short-term and long-term effects of COVID-19. Additionally, I make predictions based on the observed data. The techniques employed in this research include traditional time-series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX, and SARIMAX, as well as advanced methods like VAR and deep learning techniques. These diverse approaches allow for a thorough examination of COVID-19's influence on various sectors.
